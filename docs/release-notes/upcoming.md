# Upcoming

User-facing release notes for the next version. Plain language — no jargon or
internal module names.

## Fixes

- **A refused `tcw work edit` now changes nothing.** If one part of the command
  is refused (an unregistered tag, a blocker that would make items wait on each
  other in a loop), none of it is applied. Before, the blockers were saved and
  only then was the command refused.
- **The web app no longer lets you save an item as blocking itself**, or a
  blocker that would make items wait on each other in a loop.
