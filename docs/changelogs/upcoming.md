Developer changelog for the next version. Technical and precise; grouped by
category.

### Fixed

- `tcw work edit` changes nothing when it refuses any part of a command. It used
  to write `--unblocked-by`, `--blocked-by` and `--blocks` before `update_work`
  validated tags, so e.g. `--blocked-by Y --tag unregistered` recorded the
  blocker and then exited 1. New `WorkStore.check_blocker_edits` checks the
  blocker edits together, against the item's proposed blockers, before any write;
  `_edit` then runs `update_work` and only then the blocker writes.
- `update_work(blockers=...)` — the web app's save path — now refuses a newly
  added self-block or blocking cycle, through the same `_check_new_blocker`
  rule `add_blocker` uses. Entries the item already has are not re-checked, so
  an item already in a cycle stays saveable.
