# Upcoming

Developer changelog for the next version. Technical and precise; grouped by
category.

## Added

- `work.tracker.transitions` accepts `submit`, `rework`, `complete` and `discard`
  alongside `claim`, naming the transition each move applies. `discard` takes one
  name or one per discard resolution, and may be partial. A named transition that
  the ticket does not offer, that matches more than one offered transition, or that
  leads to a status other than the mapped one is refused before anything is sent.
  Validation is shape-only, as for `statuses`.
- Tracker sync walks a ticket forward when TCW has never claimed it: the claim, then
  one transition per mapped status, re-reading between hops, up to where the item is.
  Bounded by the ladder of mapped statuses and forward-only. `tcw work tracker link`
  now writes a `pending`/`claim: owed` sync record when it binds an item past
  `backlog`, which is both true and what makes the catch-up reachable from
  `tcw work tracker sync`.

## Fixed

- A discard moves a ticket nobody is assigned; every other move still refuses one,
  and a ticket assigned to another account is still never moved. The post-transition
  read-back no longer demands the ticket be assigned to the caller for resolved work,
  which had turned a successful unassigned discard into `did not reach 'Won't Do': it
  is in 'Won't Do'`, and the progress comment for such a discard is posted rather
  than skipped.
- Drift is judged against the whole path from where the ticket was left to the move's
  target, so a hand move to an intermediate mapped status is accepted instead of
  reported as drift. The path is walked toward the target rather than derived by
  inverting the status mapping, which is ambiguous when `completed` and `discarded`
  map to one name.
- `tcw work tracker sync <slug>` exits 1 when the named item was started by somebody
  else, naming the owed record and `TCW_WORK_OWNER`; `--all` still exits 0. Strict
  mode's refusal names the owner to run as, so its "run sync" advice can no longer
  end in a silent success.
- Messages distinguish an unassigned ticket from one somebody else holds.

## Internal

- `ladder_steps`/`ladder`/`forward_from` in `tcw/tracker/sync.py` express the mapped
  statuses as an ordered ladder, used both for the drift window and for the walk.
  `assess_move` takes the move it is serving and the transition named for it.
- `tests/tracker_fake.py` records applied transition ids and gains the `AMBIGUOUS`,
  `STRICT_LADDER` and `BROKEN_LADDER` workflows.
