# Upcoming

Developer changelog for the next version. Technical and precise; grouped by
category.

The `v2.5.0` tag was pushed but never published: the release workflow's test job
failed, so the PyPI upload never ran. `v2.5.1` is the first published release
carrying everything listed under `v2.5.0`.

### Fixed

- `tests/test_tracker_cli.py`'s `node` fixture sets `TCW_WORK_OWNER`.
  `test_an_owed_item_can_still_be_started` and
  `test_one_owed_item_does_not_break_lifecycle_moves_on_every_other_item` run
  `tcw work start`, which needs a claimant and otherwise falls back to the git
  identity. The CI runner has none, so both failed there and passed locally.
- `docs/release-notes/v2.5.0.md` linked #43 under the wrong repository.
